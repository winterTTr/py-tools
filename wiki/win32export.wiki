export virable on windows like *nix


= Details =

You should be used to use _export_ on Linux and it is really convenient.
So we can do the same thing on windows via *win32export*

{{{
import win32export
win32export.export( "name" , "value" )
}}}

That's all.
And this export is permanent , and you don't need to reboot your system.
